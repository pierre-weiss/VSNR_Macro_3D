# VSNR_Macro_3D
Source codes of the VSNR_Macro_3D Fiji plugin

This plugin is dedicated to the Fiji open-source software. The VSNR_Macro_2D and VSNR_Macro_3D cab be used to denoise or destripe images. 
Their graphical interface is minimalist compared to the first version of the plugin available here:

You can find some documentation on this website.

The codes depend on the FFT library codes written by Piotr Wendykier.
